It was adapted for the screen three times and was also adapted for the stage and radio. Private detective Philip Marlowe is investigating a dead-end missing person case when he sees a felon, Moose Malloy, barging into a nightclub called Florian's, looking for his ex-girlfriend Velma Valento. The club has changed owners, so no one now there knows her. Malloy ends up killing the black owner of the club and escaping. The murder case is assigned to Lt. Nulty, a Los Angeles Police detective who has no interest in the murder of a black man. Marlowe advises Nulty to look for Malloy's girlfriend, but Nulty prefers to let Marlowe do the routine legwork and rely on finding Malloy based on his huge size and loud clothes. Marlowe decides to follow up and look for the girl. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هفدهم ماه مارس سال2017میلادیعنوان: بدرود محبوبم (خداحافظ زیبای من)؛ نویسنده: ریموند چندلر؛ مترجم: موژان چگینی؛ تهران، نشر چترنگ، سال1395؛ در290ص؛ شابک9786008066484؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده20مبدرود، محبوبم عنوان رمانی پلیسی، جنایی نوشته «ریموند چندلر» است که نخستین بار در سال1940میلادی منتشر شد، با اقتباس از این کتاب سه فیلم سینمایی ساخته شده است؛ کارآگاه «فلیپ مارلو» به دنبال شوهر گمشده ی یک زن است؛ تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 17/05/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 23/02/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی

A kind of honestly is his code, yet does bend a little for his needs... constantly smoking cigarettes, drinking hard liquor and chasing careless women, not always he doesn't partake while sleeping. In a routine cheap case , (when he can collect his fee) of trying to find a runaway, a Greek husband, Marlowe on Central Avenue in Los Angeles 1940 gazes at the titanic and dangerous Moose Malloy, on an incessant mission, this former jailbird is six and a half feet tall, 260 lbs., dwarfs the amazed private eye, the recent unwisely released bank robber, is looking for his lost love the mysterious cute redhead Velma, enters the shady establishment the Florian nearby, he worked in eight long years ago then a nightclub now a gambling den, ( not legal, but in this city, no questions are asked) soon a man goes flying out the door landing in the gutter, the dumb Moose returns grabs Philip like he's a paper doll and takes him upstairs, his shoes hardly touch the steps, after a brief argument the bouncer bounces very high, Mr.Malloy opens the door ( he wants information, now) not realizing things have changed... to an office in the back, does not get any...a homicide occurs the unstoppable force has been let loose . The cops don't trust Mr.Marlowe even the honest ones, asking him many questions and they do not like his answers, threatening to take away his license he has heard that before, finally, let him walk out of their dingy downtown police headquarters, however all the troubles aren't any of his concern... A new case that pays well 100 bucks just to be a bodyguard, his client the nervous Mr. Lindsay Marriott, maybe a loathsome gigolo, he dresses well though and has good manners, involved with the wife of a multi -millionaire among others, the beautiful Mrs. Lewin ( Helen) Grayle but money doesn't smell, ( not always) things go dark and when Philip awakes at night in the lonely canyon, his client is no more...Marlowe will have to travels through the unsavory, with corruption everywhere he goes, mostly in the nearby small town of Bay City, ( Santa Monica)... meeting pretentious quacks, political bosses dirty cops, drug pushing doctors visiting gambling boats off the coast, the rich creeps too even a "good girl", (who scares him ) and with little help to solve several murders... Raymond Chandler describes Los Angeles as nobody before or after has, the underbelly and upper crust all of it, he knows how to write his plots are not what's important in his novels but characterization, style, pace, atmosphere and witty dialogue that few authors can ever reach or even attempt , talent is inherited, out of many only the giants will climb the heights of this eternal scribe.

And at the same time added to my anxiety. There are too many great books to read. I have at least 3k physical books on my TBR pile in my office that has really turned into a book storage space. When another reader posts something about one of my favorite books, I stop and think about how much I loved that book. That’s what happened recently with Farewell My Lovely. I dropped what I was reading and read it again. I don’t have time to reread books not with with such a tall TBR pile that continually beckons…and yet I do because that’s what the reading experience is all about. Great reads. I’ve read Farewell my Lovely a number of times and with each reading I catch something I’d missed. This book is timeless and one of the greats with the voice and turn-of-phrase that many have tried to duplicate and have failed. I highly recommend this book.David Putnam author of The Bruno Johnson series.

Of his novels,I'd say this is one of the best character-driven ones.It was published in 1940,and the content is somewhat old fashioned,but every time I open this book,I can meet timeless Philip Marlowe,a man of principle.Just for this reason,I'll be reading it forever.

Not my type.""You don't like them nice?" He had another cigarette going. The smoke was being fanned away from his face by his hand."I like smooth shiny girls, hardboiled and loaded with sin."Hey, copper, it's how I talk, see? MahhhhhhThis was exactly what the doctor ordered after a blitz of wonderful yet terribly earnest books, one after the other. This classic noir was everything I needed. A handsome private dick (ahem), a heist of some rare jade jewels, mysterious beauties, lots of alcohol, clever wisecracks, and great writing.

Moose kills a man and Marlowe gets corralled into looking for the missing Velma. In the mean time, Marlowe gets another gig as a bodyguard and soon winds up with a corpse for a client. Will Marlowe find Velma and get to the bottom of things?As I've said before, noir fiction and I go together like chronic constipation and heroin addiction. Farewell, My Lovely, Philip Marlowe's sophmore adventure, is one of the better noir tales I've ever read.I wasn't completely sold on Farewell, My Lovely at first. It seemed like it took a little longer to get started than the Big Sleep. Once Marlowe got warmed up and I forgave it for not being The Big Sleep, I was completely absorbed by the writing. Chandler's poetic prose only got better in the gap between the Big Sleep and this book. There were even more quotable lines in this one. Chandler's similes reminded me of P.G. Wodehouse's at times, maybe the kind old Plum would write if he was in the grips of a powerful hangover."I lit a cigarette. It tasted like a plumber's handkerchief."As for the plot, it's only slightly less convoluted than the Big Sleep. The two cases didn't intersect much until the end and I only guessed the big twist a paragraph or two before it happened. As with the previous book, the prose was the star of the show. Marlowe took so many blows to the head in this one that I had sympathy pains while reading it.While I wouldn't say it's as good as The Big Sleep, Farewell, My Lovely is a classic and not to be missed by noir fans. Four easy stars.

Are there other authors or titles that come to mind, perhaps even more focused on the primacy of style?Steve: Well, let’s see… Maybe the first book I read where a certain shadowy deportment really popped as a pure statement of style was Raymond Chandler’s Farewell, My Lovely. The book itself was a cannibalization of three earlier short stories of his. Whereas the stories were neatly contained as standalones, the edits in piecing them together were more slapdash, sacrificing both congruency and clarity in the process. Chandler responded saying, "My whole career is based on the idea that the formula doesn't matter, the thing that counts is what you do with the formula; that is to say, it is a matter of style.” And of course that hard-boiled, noir feel of his is prevalent to this day. Audience Question: I may be taking you further afield, but is this visual, visceral style brought on by Chandler one that necessarily de-emphasizes plot?Steve: I don’t think so. Style is not everything. (Nor is image, much as Andre Agassi would have us believe on Canon's behalf.) Furthermore, …Audience Question: [interrupting what would surely have been an insightful elaboration on the topic of substance v. style] But think back to the movies. When you picture Bogie and Bacall in The Big Sleep, do you remember the on-screen chemistry and the wise guy patter, or is it a plot detail, something like the perp who stole the falcon, that stuck with you? Steve: Actually, wasn’t that Dashiell…Audience member: [blurting out] For me, it’s Bogie and Bacall. Even in black and white they sizzle. Steve: Admittedly, HumpBac, as I like to call them (retrofitting a nickname) were iconic, but…Another audience member: Those couple combo names have kind of run their course, don’t you think? Who’s even together at this point? Certainly not Brangelina. TomKat? – no. Zanessa? – no. Yet another voice from the audience: What about Bennifer? Are they? It’s hard to keep track. And another: I don’t think so. I suppose Lizard (that is, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton) were the first of the on-again, off-again power couples.Host: I’m afraid we may be veering off course as litterateurs, my friends. This isn’t an episode of I Love Lucy, after all. Should we redirect ourselves? Steve?Steve: Actually, that’s often how it works with me – seemingly on point for brief spurts before devolving into flapdoodle. Besides, I just thought of another one: Lucille Ball + Desi Arnaz. They’d be Ba, Bu, bu, b…Susan (Steve's lovely): You’re mumbling in your sleep again.Steve: Huh?Susan: Must be another pizza dream.Steve: Yeah, [shaking cobwebs from his head] that and the bibimbap I had for lunch. With extra hot sauce.Susan: So what were you dreaming?Steve: Ha, I think I was getting some kind of award and spouting complete nonsense, like in one of my Goodreads reviews where I have nothing to say but say it anyway. The only thing I remember from it is groping for a certain word.Susan: Do you remember what it is?Steve: Yeah. Ballsy. Steve: [continuing, somewhat incredulous] I know, it doesn’t make any sense to me either. Susan: Hmm. Definitely a pizza dream.

If much of the book seems familiar, it may be that you read it many years ago or that so many of the motifs were borrowed and used by so many other private eye writers over the years. But if you want to know how it's really done, you return to the master Hardboiled craftsman himself. I always picture Philip Marlowe as Humphrey Bogart and no one can ever shake that image from me. However, Bogart only played Marlowe in the film adaptation of the first book in the series, The Big Sleep. For Farewell, My Lovely, you get the film images of Dick Powell and Robert Mitchum many decades later.But, you always get the mean streets of Los Angeles no matter how you picture Marlowe. These streets range from the seedy joints lining Central Avenue to the estates in Beverly Hills and Brentwood Heights. The streets lead of course to Chandler's fictional Bay City, loosely based on what was a crooked Santa Monica right down to the gambling boats three legal miles offshore. Marlowe here is always quick with a quip but world-weary. He's seen it all a time or two and nothing necessarily surprises him except maybe getting knocked out when he's playing bodyguard or locked up and drug-addled in a sanitarium. The very beginning of the novel sets the whole attitude as Marlowe nonchalantly accepts a great big ape of a guy, Moose Malloy, no less, throwing a guy bodily out if his way. Moose is a great character, a singleminded maniac returned to the street after eight years in the pen and determined to find his gal, Vera. Gil Brewer later created a whole novel about such a guy in A Killer Is Loose. All the usual Hardboiled rackets are well-represented here from blackmail to fortune telling to crooked cops to payoffs to rich folks living in a different world. Through it all, Marlowe resolutely starts adding up all these things that just don't add up and couldn't possibly be related. But what makes it such a joy to read is the fantastic prose, the descriptions of people and places that just bring them to life, often with a sardonic humor.

He’s also a racist alcoholic, and after all the blows to the head he routinely takes, he’s almost certainly suffering from post-concussion syndrome so you gotta question his judgment.But he’s also the guy that says things like this:"It was a blonde. A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained-glass window."And this:"He looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food cake."And this:”" I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance, I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat and a gun. I put them on and went out of the room.”So I always find myself making allowances for Marlowe’s bad habits and personal failings.Marlowe is working a boring job trying to find a missing husband when he has the bad luck to come across Moose Malloy. Malloy is a giant hulk of a man who just got out of prison and is looking for his lost love, Velma. Unfortunately, Moose is kind of simple and doesn’t know his own strength so he ends up killing somebody when asking questions. As a witness, Marlowe tells the cops what he saw and is coerced into trying to find Velma by a lazy detective. However, a real paying job as a bodyguard for a guy delivering a ransom for the return of stolen jewelry comes up so Marlowe ditches the Malloy mess. But things don’t go quite as expected.One of the better Chandler novels, this is pretty typical Marlowe. The plot doesn’t make a lot of sense, but that’s not really important. It’s all about atmosphere and attitude. If you can get past the casual racism that litters the early chapters, you’ll find one of the classics of noir fiction.

It's a classic of crime fiction; it was first published in 1940, and it's been reviewed thousands of times, mostly by people far more competent than I.Suffice it to say that this is the second full-length novel featuring Los Angeles detective Philip Marlowe, following The Big Sleep, which had been published in 1939. Marlowe was the prototype for all the tough, wise-cracking P.I.s that would follow, and Chandler was really the first crime fiction writer to fully exploit the setting of Los Angeles. Scores of writers have followed in his footsteps, but very few have succeeded as well as Chandler did.As the book opens, Marlowe is searching for a missing husband when he encounters a mountain of a man named Moose Malloy who is staring up at a bar above the barber shop where Marlowe had hoped to find the aforementioned missing husband. Malloy, fresh out of prison after an eight-year stretch, is looking for his lost love, Velma. Malloy hasn't heard from Velma in all of that time, but that has not quenched his affections for the woman who used to work in the bar.Eight years is a long time, and in the interim, the bar, which used to be a white establishment, has now become an African-American one, although in 1940, no one would have described the place quite that politely. Well, one thing leads to another and Malloy drags Marlowe up the stairs and begins demanding answers from the people in the bar who, not surprisingly, have never heard of Velma.Malloy winds up killing someone in the bar and takes off, leaving Marlowe to explain things to the cops. From that point on, Marlowe is entangled in Malloy's search. As a sideline, he also takes a job body guarding a guy who is trying to exchange cash for a valuable jade necklace that was stolen from a friend.Neither job is simple and neither turns out very well, and before long, Marlowe is up to his neck in trouble with the cops and a whole lot of other people as well. Before it's all over, he'll be beat up, doped up, pushed around, and lied to, but it's all in the nature of the job.The plot really doesn't make a lot of sense, but nobody reads Chandler for the plot. The book is beautifully written with one great line following another. Through Marlowe, Chandler rolls back the curtain and exposes the seamy side of pre-war L.A. It's not a pretty sight, and you sometimes get the impression that Marlowe might be the only honest, decent man in the state.The Big Sleep may be one of the greatest crime novels ever written, and it's an impossible act to follow, even for Raymond Chandler. I like this book a lot, but I don't think it's quite on a par with the first book in the series. A solid 4.5 stars for me.

I absolutely loved the style and imagery. I mean, SERIOUSLY loved it. Marlowe is the quintessential hard-boiled detective who is suspicious of everyone, especially the dames, clients, cops, and thugs... but he has a pretty good understanding with the thugs. The tale is fun and familiar, partly because Chandler paved the road for the best of what we know of Noir, but moreover, it's just GOOD. Snappy. Sarcastic. So VERY colorful.And because -- let's be fair -- this came out in 1940, we need to adjust our sensibilities. Just a little. As a character, Marlowe is an alcoholic racist who lets his boredom rule his feet and his mouth. I don't have to like his racism to think of him as the anti-hero that he is. He's an asshole in more ways than one. But he happens to hurt assholes, so that's viscerally okay. By today's standards, it's problematic, as are so many things that came out back then are, today, but the core and the style in this is totally brilliant. I'm often astounded by the turns of phrase. And so, for that, alone, I would totally recommend this.

And that's a-okay! I love a little private dick action and this is perfectly satisfying!This story of a thug getting out of prison and trying to find his girl is fairly straightforward, but Raymond Chandler throws a bucketload of red herrings into Farewell, My Lovely in an attempt to throw you, dear reader, off the trail. Stick to the yellow brick road, Dorothy, and you'll figure it all out in short order. Fresh off The Big Sleep detective Philip Marlowe is at it again in this sequel to that highly popular and well-written mystery. Farewell, My Lovely is an admirable followup, but it would be tough to meet or top one of the best detective novels of all time. Book two in the Marlowe series marches forward, doing its best to recreate the original with a bevy of interesting characters that are relatively well-drawn for the crime noir genre. All that good, whip-smart, wise-crackin' dialogue you know and love is in place. It's just the plot that's a little out of whack. Chandler attempts to confuse the situation, and generally succeeds, but not in a particularly clever way. It's like a muddied up pond, but a pond nonetheless, so you can swim fairly easily through the murky waters to the other side.Don't get me wrong, Farewell, My Lovely is still really good reading and any fan of the genre will enjoy it. Just don't expect a masterpiece.

Es más, me ha encantado! Desde luego Raymond Chandler supo crear un personaje único, irónico y humano que a día de hoy sigue enamorando al lector.

Philip Marlowe is the man! He gets quite knocked about in this story, which was good enough for me not to guess what was going on until I was told. And that is good enough for me!Anne, a side kick character in this story sums up the story and Marlowe like this:You’re so marvellous,’ she said. ‘So brave, so determined, and you work for so little money. Everybody bats you over the head and chokes you and smacks your jaw and fills you with morphine, but you just keep right on hitting between tackle and end until they’re all worn out. What makes you so wonderful?’Unfortunately for her, she isn't his type:‘I like smooth shiny girls, hard-boiled and loaded with sin.’I love Marlowes ability to bounce back. He is totally the dude!'I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance, I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat and a gun.'Chandler has such a way with words!'She gave me a smile I could feel in my hip pocket.'There's also a lot of beautiful landscape prose which can get missed and his attention to detail (or maybe Marlowe's) is impressive. There is a scene where he watches a little bug moving round the office and it's really quite funny and observant.It's dated -largely in a cool way. Nowadays attitudes are different but there is racism, referring to overly groomed men as pansies, the way women are thought of and described- these are historically accurate now and were contemporary at the time of writing. Everyone chain smokes and is practically alcoholic too.I love Chandler's writing and I have a black and white movie visual going on the whole way through. I see Humphrey Bogart slugging whisky in his office, then delivering his wise-cracking one liners.Superbly escapist and wonderful way to spend a few hours of my weekend!

And that scene where he picks up a stray pink bug in a police office, wraps it in his handkerchief and releases it outside speaks volumes. As does his sympathy for huge Moose Malloy on the search for his pre-prison sweetheart, Velma. The writing is sharp and extravagant, utterly distinctive, and the observations on LA create an atmosphere that permeates the text. Anne Riordan, a 'nice' girl-next-door, gets to do some flirty bickering with Marlowe but does he think he's too much in the gutter for her fragrant self? Looking forward to Marlowe #3.(Original review below)-------------------------------------------More tough-talking noir from the world-weary Marlowe as he untangles another convoluted case involving jewel heists, blackmail, corruption, a beautiful woman on the make and a feisty girl-next-door. The casual racism is jarring to modern ears with use of the N word alongside descriptions of an 'Indian' (Native American) who is 'greasy' and 'smelly' and racially-inflected slang for passing Japanese and Italian characters... But the prose is characterful and the plot flows easily - and me, I love Moose Malloy!

Συγκεκριμένα ο συνειρμός είναι ο εξής: Chandler > chandelier > πολυέλαιος > κρεμάστηκα απ’ τον πολυέλαιο (έκφραση που λέμε στην παρέα και σημαίνει συγκεκριμένα πράγματα, όποιος κατάλαβε κατάλαβε). Το αυτό ισχύει και για τον τίτλο. Σε ένα noir μυθιστόρημα, ακόμη και αυτές οι λεπτομέρειες είναι κομμάτια που συνθέτουν ένα άλφα κλίμα. Αυτό το περιρρέον κλίμα είναι ένας ολόκληρος κόσμος, ένα χαλί πάνω στο οποίο ο αναγνώστης θα κυλιστεί, θα τυλιχτεί, θα μυρίσει και θα νιώσει. Ναι, το noir είναι κατά βάση μια αισθαντική εμπειρία. Είναι σαν ένας ιστός αράχνης με πολύπλοκη δομή που θα τον τσακώσει και θα τον κρατήσει εκεί όμηρο – εφόσον τα καταφέρει, να παρακολουθήσει σφιχτά την υπόθεση με όλα της τα παρελκόμενα.Νοερά με τοποθέτησα στο φόντο του βιβλίου. Βυθίστηκα σε μια δερμάτινη πολυθρόνα. Άνοιξα μια χρυσή κασετίνα βάζοντας ένα τσιγάρο στην άκρη των χειλιών. Στο μεταξύ, οι ήχοι της jazz έφταναν στα αυτιά μου και τα μάτια μου μισόκλειναν από τη μέθη της ατμόσφαιρας. Ο Φίλιπ Μάρλοου το πήγαινε καλά. Τον εμπιστευόμουν, πάντα οριακά, κι αυτός ήταν ο λόγος που μπορούσα να αντλήσω ευχαρίστηση και να απολαμβάνω ηδονικά τα περίεργα σκηνικά που μου ξεφούρνιζε, γεμάτα ευαισθησία, αισθησιασμό, περηφάνια και τόλμη. Η προσωπικότητα του ντετέκτιβ ανέδιδε τη μελαγχολία αυτή που χαίρεται κανείς να προσλαμβάνει εκ του ασφαλούς, εξ αποστάσεως. It was a hard day’s night, αλλά το ουίσκυ θα είναι πάντα μια καλή λύση σε όλα τα προβλήματα.Ο ιδιωτικός ντετέκτιβ σέρνει τα βήματά του νωθρά ενώ το μυαλό του παίρνει χίλιες στροφές. Πίνει ουίσκυ ως το μόνο πόσιμο υγρό που θα του προσφέρει διαύγεια και λειτουργικότητα στο έργο του. Μιλάει με γρίφους που μόνο ορισμένοι του κόσμου αυτού μπορούν να αποκωδικοποιήσουν. Μπαίνει σε μια βίλα, σε ένα ψυχιατρείο, μια φυλακή, ένα σιχαμερό αστυνομικό τμήμα με την ίδια άνεση. Είναι βιοπαλαιστής, κερδίζει λίγα –δυσανάλογα με το ρίσκο–, αλλά αυτό το επάγγελμα είναι ευθυγραμμισμένο με τη φτιαξιά του. Είναι φτιαγμένος μεν να λύσει μυστήρια –σε πρώτη ανάγνωση– αλλά κυρίως να ανιχνεύσει αυτό το κάτι των κουλών αυτού του κόσμου. Αυτών που ξεστράτισαν από τον "σωστό" δρόμο από πάθος, έρωτα, δίψα για χρήμα, υπερβολική ευαισθησία ίσως. Και παραμένει πάντα δεύτερος, ποτέ ο καραμπινάτος πρωταγωνιστής που είναι σε πρώτο πλάνο και θα κερδίσει τη δόξα και την τιμή, το μεγάλο χειροκρότημα στο τέλος της παράστασης. Το σημαντικότερο όμως είναι ότι παραμένει ένας βαθιά ρομαντικός τύπος, ένας τύπος που ασκεί μια διάχυτη γοητεία και καταχωρείται τελικά ως λογοτεχνικός ήρωας με ταυτότητα.«Ήθελα ένα ποτό, ήθελα μια ασφάλεια ζωής, ήθελα διακοπές, ήθελα ένα εξοχικό σπίτι. Και το είχα; Ένα παλτό, ένα καπέλο και ένα περίστροφο. Τα φόρεσα και βγήκα από το δωμάτιο.»Τελικά το μυστικό κλειδί του noir είναι αυτό: ο νομιμόφρονας και αγαθός πολίτης μπαίνει σε δυσώδη μονοπάτια που δε θα περπατήσει ποτέ, δε θα αντιληφθεί ποτέ ότι συμβαίνουν ενώ αυτός κοιμάται μακάριος στο δεξί πλευρό, δε θα περάσει ούτε ξυστά από δίπλα γιατί πολύ απλά η απόσταση που τον χωρίζει από αυτά μετριέται σε πλανήτες. Ή και μπορεί να συμβαίνουν σε ένα παράλληλο σύμπαν, μόλις στη διπλανή πόρτα.Ο Chandler παραμένει σέξυ και μελαγχολικός κλείνοντας το βιβλίο. Πέρασε από πάνω μου ένα βερνίκι με γεύση πικρή και γλυκερή σαν του πούρου, με υφή τραχιά αλλά και μαλακή, έτσι ώστε να μου αφήσει ένα γνήσιο σημάδι τού τι εστί noir και πόσο ελκυστικό μπορεί να είναι ακόμα και για κάποιον που διατείνεται ότι δεν είναι στα αγαπημένα του genre. Στιλάτη, περιθωριακή πλην με κότσια λογοτεχνία.«-Φοβαμαι το θάνατο και την απόγνωση, είπα. Τα σκοτεινά νερά, τα πρόσωπα των πνιγμένων και τα κρανία δίχως μάτια. Φοβάμαι να πεθάνω, φοβάμαι την ανυπαρξία, φοβάμαι πως δε θα βρω κάποιον που ονομάζεται Μπρουνέτ.»

Encountering a behemoth of an ex-con, Moose Malloy, on the street, Marlowe follows the big man into a bar and witnesses a murder. And before the reader can ask, “Where’s my Velma?” – the question makes sense when you read the novel – Marlowe finds himself embroiled in police corruption, a blackmail scam, chasing a gang of jewelry thieves, another murder encounters a young female who becomes his pseudo-partner, meets up with a psychic con-man and a crooked doctor and is propositioned by a beautiful young woman who is married to a much older and very wealthy man. All the while Marlowe attempts to keep tabs on Moose.If possible the plot/story-line of Farewell, My Lovely is even more convoluted than its predecessor, The Big Sleep. Marlowe meeting new players with each twist and turn of the investigation and getting physically bounced around on a regular basis. (For the politically correct there are a handful of racial slurs here which may make the reader cringe.) But somehow the author ties it all together in the end with maybe a not so neat bow.This being a Chandler novel there are plenty of classic “Marlowe-isms”. After being called to a rich client’s home, where “the carpeting almost tickled his ankles”, he describes the den he is escorted into as “a room where anything could happen, except work.”When embarking on a night’s work he makes the observation, “I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance. I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat and a gun.”Ahhhh – to be Philip Marlowe.

If I were to make a movie from a book, this would be The One. 😃The first 1/4 is quite slow, clumsy even (see below). But then it quite suddenly gets wonderful. I wish I could know what happened to Chandler to wake him up. The prose suddenly soars.Update: It turns out this book is a (clumsy) conglomeration of three of Chandler’s previous short stories: 1. Moose looking for Velma (poor)2. A stolen jade necklace (adequate)3. An adventure on an off-shore gambling boat (fail)The second is typical Chandler, complex, hard-boiled and difficult to know whom to trust. We have two candidates for the femme-fatale here, and you are kept wondering to the last page if there are one or two bad girls. I loved that.It’s a year since The Big Sleep. I wonder if Marlowe still dreams of Silver-Wig? There is a long sequence at the docks, on the water and in a ship offshore, that just plod along; no forward motion to the plot, no incentive to stay up late reading more. Chandler definitely was not "in the groove" for this section.at Chapter 7... This sucks:I was looking at him across my office desk at about four-thirty when the phone rang and I heard a cool, supercilious voice that sounded as if it thought it was pretty good. It said drawlingly, after I had answered: "You are Philip Marlowe, a private detective?"More sucky prose in chapter 7...A wedge of sunlight slipped over the edge of the desk and fell noiselessly to the carpet. Traffic lights bong-bonged outside on the boulevard, interurban cars pounded by, a typewriter clacked monotonously in the lawyer's office beyond the party wall. I had filled and lit a pipe when the telephone rang again.Chapter 9... Very suddenly the prose is a lot better. Wonderful, in fact -On the highway the lights of the streaming cars made an almost solid beam in both directions. The big cornpoppers were rolling north growling as they went and festooned all over with green and yellow overhang lights. Three minutes of that and we turned inland, by a big service station, and wound along the flank of the foothills. It got quiet. There was loneliness and the smell of kelp and the smell of wild sage from the hills. A yellow window hung here and there, all by itself, like the last orange. Cars passed, spraying the pavement with cold white light, then growled off into the darkness again. Wisps of fog chased the stars down the sky.And... delicious..."You didn't have to be rough," she said, putting her hands down into the pockets of a long rough coat with flaring shoulders. "I didn't think you killed him." I liked the cool quiet of her voice. I liked her nerve. We stood in the darkness, face to face, not saying anything for a moment. I could see the brush and light in the sky. And ...It was a blonde. A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window. Interesting collection of terms from 1940 for pot:That a man occasionally smoked a stick of tea, a man who looked as if any touch of the exotic would appeal to him. On the other hand lots of tough guys smoked marihuana, also lots of band musicians and high school kids, and nice girls who had given up trying. American hasheesh. A weed that would grow anywhere. Unlawful to cultivate now. 41% .... "Oh, I hope you can." She gave me a smile I could feel in my hip pocket. 54% ...Chandler hard boils it, then breaks out the blow torch. Awesome!56% ... Fabulous. The existential gumshoe...Hemingway went around and pushed his hard stomach behind the wheel. He started the car. We turned and drifted off down the driveway lined with wild geraniums. A cold wind lifted off the sea. The stars were too far off. They said nothing. .85% ... lagging badly here. Way too much time messing about on the docks and the water. Dull dialogue.And in the very end, the heart, the detective-philosopher, the human condition.... Wonderful...  Think that over. And who would that trial hurt most? Who would be least able to bear it? And win, lose or draw, who would pay the biggest price for the show? An old man who had loved not wisely, but too well." Movie versionsThere is a very early movie version which I have not seen, The Falcon Takes Over.I also watched the 1945 Dick Powell movie version, Murder, My Sweet, which was quite a mess. Some good parts of the book were preserved, but mostly the book had it's arms and legs amputated, and it's heart and brain scrambled.I'm watching the 1975 version with Robert Mitchum, Charlotte Rampling, Sylvia Miles, the late and wonderful Harry Dean Stanton and (surprise!) Sylvester Stallone! This started well, although Mitchum is much, much too old to play Marlowe. The "romance scene" with Charlotte Rampling (29) and Robert Mitchum (a worn-out 57) was cringe-worthy. Then the movie goes farther and farther off track. I didn’t even finish watching it. What a waste of time.

It is always good to follow these stories of the hard drinking detective and this is a fairly good story. Unfortunately, it drifts in the middle and comes to its completion much later than I would have liked. It almost seems as if the publishers ask the author if he could stretch the story by adding another hundred pages in the middle. Enough Chandler there to make it a worthwhile, but possibly not his best.

John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee, Lee Child's Jack Reacher, and Jo Nesbø's, Harry Hole (to name a few).Like Reacher, Harry, and Travis, Marlowe is also incredibly funny, smart and can take care of business with confidence when the situation warrants. Always get a huge kick out of how he handles his lady suitors, calling a spade a spade like nobody's business. He is never lured in with mindless flirtation, and listening to him use his witty dry humor to put people in their place is priceless.Raymond Chandler a genius at his craft, and nothing I can say can describe how good his books are other than (if you have not already) read them, and enjoy.

I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat and a gun. I put them on and went out of the room.”While working a missing persons case, Detective Philip Marlowe finds himself drawn into a murder investigation. Jailbird Moose Malloy knocks off the proprietor of a local watering hole in his pursuit of a gal named Velma. While assisting the cops in hunting him down, Marlowe backs off the case when he realizes he won’t be paid for his efforts. However it’s not long before another job falls in his lap when Marlowe is hired to accompany a man in a money-for-jewelry trade off. When his employer is tucked in for the big sleep, Marlowe tries to piece the crime together, taking a few lumps in the process.As abrasive as a sheet of sandpaper coated in shattered glass, Philip Marlowe isn’t one to check his attitude at the door. He’s also an alcoholic, a racist, and unapologetically hardheaded. With all these character flaws, why is Raymond Chandler’s signature series so damn enjoyable? It probably has something to do with Chandler’s endlessly quotable prose.The backbone of any story worth reading is the way the author’s prose plays out on the page. You could have the most exciting plot imaginable but if the writing isn't up to snuff, it’s not worth the paper it’s printed on, but sometimes an author can be so good that the plot is almost secondary. The true joy can come from random musings about life, death and everything in between or even the exceptional way an author crafts a setting or describes a character. Raymond Chandler is one such author and while the case surrounding Farewell, My Lovely isn't particularly outstanding, he is certainly a masterful storyteller.Throughout the story, Chandler takes the reader in a multitude of directions and when Marlowe makes any sort of headway, a new element is introduced thus changing the case. It’s often a wonder Marlowe gets anything done when half the time he’s soaking himself in bourbon while seemingly trying to burn bridges with his smarmy attitude and general distaste for anyone he meets.Farewell, My Lovely is an excellent novel and a more than worthy follow up to The Big Sleep. Chandler’s Philip Marlowe is one hell of an interesting character leaving me sad to know there are only six books in the series.Also posted @ Every Read Thing

È soltanto una storia fosca e piena di sangue». In una Los Angeles anni ’40 l’investigatore privato Philip Marlowe si trova casualmente presente sulla scena del crimine. In realtà, non dovrebbe esserci nulla d’interessante dato che la vittima è solo uno “scarafaggio”.” Accese mezzo sigaro e gettò il cerino sul pavimento, dove già molti altri lo attendevano. La sua voce disse amaramente:«Scarafaggi. Un'altra uccisione di scarafaggi. Ecco che cosa mi capita dopo diciotto anni di servizio. Niente taglia e niente stampa. Nemmeno due righe di cronaca».”Così si designano nell’ambiente poliziesco gli afroamericani poiché proprio come gli scarafaggi sono esseri infimi non degni di rientrare nella cerchia umana. Un caso, pertanto, che appare di quart’ordine tanto che neppure la stampa si scomoda a scriverne un trafiletto. Di mezzo, però, c’è la scomparsa dell’affascinante Vilma e lei è bianca e di questo sì che vale la pena occuparsi. Così si srotola una storia in cui Chandler dimostra una grande capacità descrittiva. Nulla sfugge. Non c’è personaggio o ambiente che non sia tratteggiato nei minimi dettagli.Tra descrizioni accurate di polsini, bottoni, rughe, pavimenti e quant’altro, c’è Marlowe.Un duro, uno che non molla e si districa tra bugie e manganellate citando Shakespeare, facendo riferimenti a Rembrandt tanto per farci capire che non è l’ultimo dei caproni. Quello che stupisce è piuttosto come riesca a ricordarsene data la quantità industriale di whisky che ingurgita.Un romanzo che, a mio avviso, non supera la prova del tempo sia per lo stile di scrittura sia per l’esplicito razzismo (oltre agli scarafaggi appare anche un indiano e la sua caratteristica principale è quella di puzzare e parlare come un troglodita…) ed una vena misogina. Tracce concrete di ciò che oggi designeremmo come  politically incorrect .Tre stelle per aver dato i natali al genere hard boiled dimostrando coraggio nel descrivere la corruzione morale in un’epoca di censure. Un autore amato come dimostrano commenti e votazioni dei lettori ma probabilmente non è il genere di lettura che mi manda in estasi. «Siete fantastico», disse. «Così coraggioso, così risoluto, così disposto a lavorare per pochi quattrini. Tutti vi prendono a manganellate in testa, vi strangolano, vi spaccano la mascella e vi riempiono di morfina, ma voi continuate a tirar dritto come se niente fosse finché li avete fatti fuori tutti. Ma com'è che siete così straordinario?».

The characters are such great throw backs to the days when men were Men and women were Dames. Chandler's writing is amazingly rich for this genre and the plot lines are just convoluted enough to keep you guessing. Phillip Marlowe is a great faceted character which contrasts nicely against the one-dimensional villains, cops and women who populate the stories. If authors like Sue Grafton are the gummi bears of the genre (low-cal, low fat, but tasty and fun), Raymond Chandler is the 70% dark chocolate.

You know that around every corner will be something new, some person popping out with a chainsaw to make you scream. In Chandler's case, it is an incredible description or metaphor or stylized piece of dialogue that will make you scream, and they'll be screams of delight.Consider this description:A large, thick-necked Negro was leaning against the end of the bar with pink garters on his shirt sleeves and pink and white suspenders crossing his broad back. He had bouncer written all over him. He put his lifted foot down slowly and turned slowly and stared at us, spreading his feet gently and moving a broad tongue along his lips. He had a battered face that looked as if it had been hit by everything but the back of a dragline. It was scarred, flattened, thickened, checkered, and welted. It was a face that had nothing to fear. Everything had been done to it that anybody could think of.In one paragraph, Raymond Chandler's genre-defining noir detective Philip Marlowe perfectly describes this bouncer and what he looks like. And when the huge convict, one Moose Malloy picks him and tosses him aside, easy as a lion swats aside a ball of yarn, well... you know you've got a man who's not to be trifled with. And you know you've got a story with more twists n turns than that same ball of yarn. But somehow, someway, Marlowe will manage to unravel it.I could, perhaps, talk more about how Philip Marlowe has spawned the long-lasting archetype for the gruff, wise-cracking broody and flawed detective with a heart of gold. But I find myself unable to give it justice. Instead let me just quote Raymond Chandler himself:In everything that can be called art there is a quality of redemption. It may be pure tragedy, if it is high tragedy, and it may be pity and irony, and it may be the raucous laughter of the strong man. But down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. The detective in this kind of story must be such a man. He is the hero; he is everything. He must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. He must be, to use a rather weathered phrase, a man of honor—by instinct, by inevitability, without thought of it, and certainly without saying it. He must be the best man in his world and a good enough man for any world. I do not care much about his private life; he is neither a eunuch nor a satyr; I think he might seduce a duchess and I am quite sure he would not spoil a virgin; if he is a man of honor in one thing, he is that in all things.He is a relatively poor man, or he would not be a detective at all. He is a common man or he could not go among common people. He has a sense of characters, or he would not know his job. He will take no man’s money dishonestly and no man’s insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him. He talks as the man of his age talks—that is, with rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness.The story is this man’s adventure in search of a hidden truth, and it would be no adventure if it did not happen to a man fit for adventure. He has a range of awareness that startles you, but it belongs to him by right, because it belongs to the world he lives in. If there were enough like him, the world would be a very safe place to live in, without becoming too dull to be worth living in.Farewell, My Lovely is my favorite Chandler novel. It's got just the right mix of sadness and mania, truth and deception, all wrapped up in Chandler's scintillating prose. So if you're the type of person who loves fine writing, you'll be hard-pressed to find finer than in these pages and a thrilling crime story to boot. That's like having your cake AND eating it too, and that's a rare thing.

For anyone who thinks crime fiction has no place in the literary world, the Marlowe novels might make you change your mind. Chandler's an amazing writer when it comes to social commentary, the similes, metaphors and the sharp, electric prose he's famous for, and of course, his superb depiction of the city of angels of the 1940s that is so lifelike you almost feel that you're along with him for the ride. The novels are also a way for Chandler to examine American society of the time.While I am not much of an analyst when it comes to reading -- a) there are a huge number of analyses of Chandler and his writing all over the place and b)I'm just not good at it so don't pretend to be -- one thing I particularly noticed in my reading was Chandler's use of the color red. To me, where ever Chandler focused on mentioning red, some kind of danger -- emotional or physical -- was nearby. Velma, Malloy's old sweetheart, was a redhead. Anne Riordan, daughter of an ex-police chief and an ally of Marlowe's in this book, is also a redhead. He likes her enough to keep some of the worst details from her and finds himself thinking about how her apartment would be a "nice room to wear slippers in." He watches a red neon light flashing in the hotel room where he stays just before getting on the water taxi to go out to the gambling boat. He meets ex-cop and boat driver Red Noorgan, with "hair the shade of red that glints with gold," who has "Violet eyes. Almost purple. Eyes like a girl, a lovely girl," with skin Marlowe describes as "soft as silk" and a voice that was "soft, dreamy, so delicate for a big man that it was startling. It made me think of another soft-voiced big man I had strangely liked." There are likely more instances, but I found the use of red quite interesting here. The mystery plots that eventually tie together are a little clunky, but I loved this novel and I wish I had read these books long before now. The writing alone is worth working through the convoluted plotlines, but most of all I love the character of Marlowe. As I found in The Big Sleep, he's a knight of sorts in a city where knights don't really have a place -- and I really like that about him. FYI -- this book was written in the 1940s so you're going to encounter some pretty ugly racial slurs and racist attitudes as you read. That sort of stuff is a bit shocking, but considering the times, not so unusual for back then.definitely recommended -- now on to the third Marlowe novel.

He was the perfect narrator to match Chandler's tough guy noir classic. I loved the rat-a-tat writing, whether actual dialog or Marlowe's first person description of the action. So many quotable lines, I'm not even going to try! Creating atmosphere is what Chandler is all about and he completely transports the reader to 1940's Los Angeles's seamier side. There was so much going on that, at times, I lost the thread, but that was only a minor irritation. The ending brought everything together and made the chaos of what preceded make sense.If the book had been written today, I would have felt it to be derivative, but this is one of the originals from which noir is derived! And if it had been written today, the view of and language used about Negroes, Italians, Mexicans and Jews would put me off for sure. But it wasn't written today and spending some time in 1940's LA made reading this book a treat. And did I mention Elliot Gould was brilliant?

He’s smart, strong, handsome, but most of all witty and clever. And tough when he has to be. He’s also, seen more clearly by today’s standards, not admirable; he’s homophobic, at times seemingly racist, certainly arrogant with some women if not misogynist, with addictions to booze and cigarettes. Which is also to say that for 1940 he is in step with the times in the old US of A. So why is he still seen as one of the Big Three of all time in this genre? It’s the writing, at turns lyrical and then witty. Here’s just some examples: “I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance, I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat and a gun. I put them on and went out of the room.” “It was a blonde. A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window. She was wearing street clothes that looked black and white, and a hat to match and she was a little haughty, but not too much. Whatever you needed, wherever you happened to be—she had it.” “I like smooth shiny girls, hardboiled and loaded with sin.” “The coffee shop smell was strong enough to build a garage on. I went back to my desk, dropped the bottle of whiskey back into the drawer, shut the drawer and sat down again.” “It was a cool day and very clear. You could see a long way-but not as far as Velma had gone.” “Even on Central Avenue, not the quietest dressed street in the world, he looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.” “He had a heart as big as one of Mae West's hips.” “Beyond the electroliers, beyond the beat and toot of the small sidewalk cars, beyond the smell of hot fat and popcorn and the shrill children and the barkers in the peep shows, beyond everything but the smell of the ocean and the suddenly clear line of the shore and the creaming fall of the waves into the pebbled spume. I walked almost alone now. The noises died behind me, the hot dishonest light became a fumbling glare. Then the lightless finger of a black pier jutted seaward into the dark. This would be the one. I turned to go out on it.” See what I mean? This is what distinguishes him from other crime/noir writers. He’s entertaining and just plain good. But as with The Big Sleep, the plot is convoluted to the point where I won’t even recount it, except to say: a woman named Velma is never physically present in this book, but she is the figure that moves it forward, the thread in the fabric one has to pull to unravel the whole cloth of the plot. Such as it is.  What are key plot/character elements? A 7 foot tall guy named Moose Malloy. Corrupt Bay City cops (you expect an LA story to feature the corrupt LAPD, but here it spreads to a neighboring community, maybe a fictionally named Santa Monica?). Offshore gambling boats. At least three different villains, lots of hot dames, of course. But in the middle of it, you just have to (finally, I’ll say) fall in love with Marlowe, with his cynical patter. Not quite as great as The Big Sleep, but still a classic!

The intensive plots and the final plot twist would leave you breathless, Mr. Chandler's characters are badass and hard boiled to the core; the atmosphere of nior is just perfect, absolutely perfect. Plus when I re-read this book, I absolutely love seeing the 1940s American society through the MC's eyes and I also noticed just how awesomely Mr. Chandler could write!

Chandler’s writing is awesome—very expressive, yet very spare. Each novel is a complete joy, but not padded with anything extra. Occasional, brief descriptions of surroundings paint a full picture with very few strokes. His vocabulary choices are spot on. A delight to read.I very much receive the impression that Philip Marlowe is Raymond Chandler’s alter-ego, the man that he fantasized about being. Handsome, brave, always knowing what to do, street smart, alluring to the ladies, and able to handle his liquor or a punch to the face. By all accounts a troubled man, Chandler certainly wrote the drinking scenes like he knew what he was talking about. It may have been the thing that he and Marlowe shared most in common.Beautiful writing about less than beautiful subjects—Chandler is one of the masters.

And I must admit that I understand why it is so popular. There is an undeniable charm to these stories.First of all, Marlowe himself has his own specific charm, which also results from the fact that he is a completely unreal character. He is a tough guy who, against all odds, strives for justice as he understands it. No woman is immune to his allure. And the number of times someone tries to kill or beats him is almost absurd. And yet he works great as the main character of the series and has become a model for other similar characters.I think I liked the plot of this book the least of those I've read, which does not mean that it was a bad book. But I think the plot is rather complicated and it is not necessary. There are several threads here that, at one point or another, connect and intersect. There are also a lot of characters, although fortunately they are quite easy to distinguish. Even if determining who played what role in this story is a little more difficult. And that's what I mean when I say this story is unnecessarily complicated. Of course, the final answers to the whole story turn out to be very simple.Despite what I wrote above, I had a lot of fun reading this book. Marlowe is the main character you want to follow through this story. It always seemed to me that he was one step ahead of me, that he saw something that I did not notice. And while that wasn't always true, it felt good.

Nobody knew how to turn a phrase like good old Ray-Ray. I mean, what a guy. What a kick he must have been at parties.I don't normally read books for language alone. I'm an emotional reader, and my emotions tend to be tickled by character development and plot rather than language, and I'm a sucker for a well-turned phrase in service of plot or character. But Raymond Chandler's books I really couldn't care less about character or plot. With him, it's all about atmosphere, and despite the dark seedy underbelly exposed in his books, his sense of diction is so playful. Just take a look at this gorgeous passage. It's so simple, but so full of attitude:"The call had come at 10:08. Marriott had talked maybe two minutes. Another four had got us out of the house. Time passes very slowly when you are actually doing something. I mean, you can go through a lot of movements in very few minutes. Is that what I mean? What the hell do I care what I mean? Okay, better men than me have meant less. Okay, what I mean is, that would be 10:15, say. The place was about twelve minutes away. 10:27. I get out, walk down in the hollow, spend at the most eight minutes fooling around and come on back up to get my head treated. 10:35. Give me a minute to fall down and hit the ground with my face. The reason I hit it with my face, I got my chin scraped. It hurts. It feels scraped. That way I know it’s scraped. No, I can’t see it. I don’t have to see it. It’s my chin and I know whether it’s scraped or not. Maybe you want to make something of it. Okay, shut up and let me think."I mean, come on! I was going to try and imitate his writing for this review, but I just don't have that kind of sass in me. Who calls getting banged on the head "getting my head treated"? I don't know. There's just something about it that makes me laugh.And the plot in this one is extra discombobulated because Chandler cannibalized three separate short stories he'd already written and reworked them into one story. so it's like he's got three separate things going on with very little to connect them: a story about a very large man just released from prison who Marlowe witnesses killing a black man in a night club, and who the police are looking for; the search for a night club singer that used to work in the night club, but hasn't been seen for eight years; and a story about a psychic who also deals in organized crime, and has bought off sections of the police force. But still, he makes it work because what he's concentrating on is the writing and the characters, not the details of the plot. He's like a magician waving his hands and getting you to look at one thing, and forget the other exists.I highly recommend the Philip Marlowe audiobooks, specifically the version narrated by Elliott Gould. His voice is absolutely perfect for Marlowe, and he nails the deadpan tone of the thing.

I read Farewell, My Lovely (1939) (Philip Marlowe #2) within days of finishing the first novel The Big Sleep. I've never read them in order before. Whilst I preferred the writing in The Big Sleep, I now realise that the plot is far more satisfying in this book. After the epic and mythical quest comes the more prosaic world of corruption as two seemingly unconnected plotlines gradually start to converge. Raymond Chandler's writing is always a delight but in this outing Marlowe encounters some truly memorable characters, not least the man moutain Moose Malloy.Chandler's hard boiled fiction is still as fresh and modern as the day his Marlowe novels were first published. It's only the casual racism and sexism of his era which jars.5/5Marlowe's about to give up on a completely routine case when he finds himself in the wrong place at the right time to get caught up in a murder that leads to a ring of jewel thieves, another murder, a fortune-teller, a couple more murders, and more corruption than your average graveyard. Best-known as the creator of the original private eye, Philip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler was born in Chicago in 1888 and died in 1959. Many of his books have been adapted for the screen, and he is widely regarded as one of the very greatest writers of detective fiction.

He's a homophobic, mysogynist racist with a pretty large booze and cigarettes monkey hanging from his back. A lot of this can be put down to the time in which he operates; almost everybody held the same prejudices in that time and place. It still makes for uncomfortable reading for this 21st century liberal at times.Why am I reading this, then? Well, it's pretty simple: Chandler's writing is phenomenal. He pretty much defined the crime noir genre with his beautifully descriptive writing. (Could he be any more seminal? Sorry; wrong Chandler...) He doesn't so much write as paint pictures with words and beautiful, if grimy, pictures they are.Also, his 'voice' is so distinctive and so engaging that it supersedes the unlikeable nature of his characters and skewers the reader like a maggot on a rusty fishhook, making it impossible to look away. It's compulsive, addictive fare that defies the reader not to enjoy it. I'm certainly whipping through these books like a vindaloo through my digestive system.

In this tale he stumbled into a missing person case handed over to him by a disinterested detective.As usual, Marlowe meets colorful characters and suffers for it.This was an audio version by Elliot Gould. I doubt I can listen to any other audio narrator as he does it so well and you can tell he loves the novel series. MY GRADE: B plus to A minus.

Immersed in the beauty of his prose, the way in which he presents his world, the timing of his humour, one scarcely notices the storyline, and I use that word advisedly.As it happened, style's been uppermost in my mind lately while editing a friend's autobiographical ms. In her attempt to find her style she has resorted to a heavy-handed use of The Rhetorical Comma. Eventually they began to enrage me. I pictured lining them up in front of a firing squad and obliterating them with bullets. I began viciously stabbing at them. Her ms. is now covered in angry crosses and one word spat out over and over, as if out of a Dalek. Omit. Omit. Omit.Rest here:https://alittleteaalittlechat.wordpre...

I was expecting this to be a noir but basically it was a like a Sherlock Holmes short story expanded to a novel. And for that reason, despite my failed expectation, I liked this book.The language is quite old. This is because the setting is in Los Angeles during the 20's and the characters belong to the city's dark underworld, i.e., nightlife, crimes, drugs, murder. Racial discrimination is still rampant. The murder of a dead black man (the book still uses the "N" word, that's one reason I say the language is old) is brushed aside by the LAPD and is assigned to a lazy and incompetent investigator, Nulty. Our hero, Philip Marlowe is in the scene when the murder happened and so, being perhaps bored, he becomes interested in the case. The murder is committed by a huge black guy Moose Malloy who is looking for his girlfriend Velma Valento. To solve that crime, Marlowe tries to find Valento. Little does he know that his curiosity will lead him to a situation where his power of deduction ala-Sherlock Holmes will be needed.I was not able to guess the ending. I never knew that Velma to Mrs. Grayle transformation. Not even when the older lady began to hit on him. So, that was the reason why Valento is barely described in the first half of the page. When Upon realizing that this was the case, I said: "Whaaat? Are you kidding me?" Then I went back to the first few pages and noticed that yes, there were very sketchy description of Velma Valento. Chandler really got me here.My second Chandler and I liked this better than his The Long Goodbye (3 stars). This is faster-paced and the plot is more engaging.I should read his The Big Sleep next.

Now he is out of prison, and he wants Velma back. Private Investigator Philip Marlowe is in a bit of a dry patch and has no other work on so decides to help Malloy. But soon what started as a missing person search becomes something much more sinister.This is the second book in the series and once again we get the 'mean' streets of Los Angeles ranging from the seedy joints lining Central Avenue to the estates in Beverly Hills and Brentwood Heights before heading to the fictional Bay City, loosely based on a crooked Santa Monica.Marlowe is a world-weary, 'hardboiled' PI who is always quick with a witty quip and is the antipathy of the phrase dogged, no matter what is done to him physically he just keeps ploughing on as if to prove the adage that 'you can't keep a good man down'. Moose Malloy is also an interesting character. We first meet him literally throwing a guy bodily out of his way, he is a single-minded maniac but one that tends to hurt people without really intending to, he simply doesn't realise his own strength. But what makes this an interesting read is the prose. The book is dotted with wonderful metaphors that just bring the people and places to life, often with a sardonic humor. On the downside the book is also littered with examples of casual racism and misogyny which simply wouldn't be accepted today. I'm not a fan of censorship and want to read books just as they were written but that doesn't mean that I don't feel uncomfortable whilst I'm doing so, hence why I've marked it down.

His prose comes across as the text equivalent of a master blues guitarist's playing, having a fantastic well thought out rhythm and cadence to it even as it lapses into melancholy romanticism yet despite all that coming across as effortless and natural. Another apt comparison would be epic poetry ruminating over the human condition's most desparate corners disguised as the rambling monologue of a barroom drunk.However, another reason the blues analogy is perhaps more useful would be the way Chandler structures the story of his novels. They follow less the linear-yet-convoluted plot structure of setting up and resolving mysteries as demonstrated by Chandler's contemporaries Dashiell Hammett and Georges Simenon, but feel more like literary riffing or jamming over a few central themes. That said, "Farewell My Lovely" strikes me as significantly more coherent and well-structured than the other output I have read from the man. The plot follows Philip Marlowe's quest to unravel the connections between two apparently unconnected riddles: The first involving an oddly sympathetic ex-con named Moose Malloy, whom my generation instantly will recognize as the prototype for Marv from "Sin City", whose fiancee disappears inexplicably while he's in jail; the other involving a shady businessman being anonymously blackmailed by a ring of jewel thieves on very strange terms.Marlowe's investigations of not just those two mysteries, but also exactly what they have to do with each other, leads him from ghettos and slums to luxurious mansions and resorts as it brings him into contact with vast criminal conspiracies hidden just underneath the surface of respected legal businesses, the public services ostensibly sworn to protect against such corruption and even the offices of psychic mediums. Despite this journey having a clearer narrative structure to it than the author's debut novel "The Big Sleep", most of the central clues Marlowe still discovers and the investigation's methodological nuts-and-bolts are less important to the story than the meditations on the shadow sides of human nature and modern society as demonstrated by the characters and milieus described.The important part is not the investigative A-to-B of how Marlowe uncovers that conspiracy. It's what the process tells him and the reader about how otherwise sympathetic and very human through no fault of their own end up on either the wrong side of the law or the wrong side of justice, how easily power corrupts, the breaking point where that corruption becomes utterly irredeemable even when it happens to the best of us, how everyone is in the end alienated and isolated from one another in the modern metropolis and last but not least how people still manage to hold on to their basic dignity in the middle of all that. That core of idealism, however jaded and pessimistic, is where I suspect that lyrical quality to the grim atmosphere of social decay in Chandler's writing comes from and how he in a sense "earns" the darkness. The fact that the balancing act I described never rings false or comes across as affected is what I suspect is Chandler's true masterstroke.

But this book had a personally touch to it. I felt intrigued, captivated and amused by this unconventional character that by the time I finished Farewell My Lovely, I could only see Marlowe as a real person come to life, rather than a fictional character. This case was a serious and dangerous one for Marlowe, HE was the one being targeted. It started when an escaped convict, looking for his girlfriend dragged Marlowe into a coloured establishment. Who then shot two employees out of confusion, and fled the scene. Marlowe was reluctant to get involved in the search for the convict – he was broke and was in need of a paid job - but a lazy and incompetent Investigating Officer pressured Marlowe to do a little snooping. Which led Marlowe into a sequence of seemingly unconnected events involving corrupted police and politicians, a jewelry heist, crime bosses and drug lords. But Marlowe interference was upsetting an unknown person or a gang, and they wanted him out of the way. He was drugged, severely beaten and choked. The torture he endured here had a lasting effect Marlowe, ruined and disturbed him in a big way. I tried to yell, for no reason at all. Breath panted in my throat and couldn’t get out. The Indian threw me sideways and got a body scissors on me as I fell. He had me in a barrel. His hands went to my neck. Sometimes I wake up in the night. I feel them there and I smell the smell of him. I feel the breath fighting and losing and the greasy fingers digging in. Then I get up and take a drink and turn the radio on.Chandler seriously out done himself; the writing was phenomenal, and while I loved what I’ve read to date, I can finally say I have witness a true literary genius in the great man. Farewell My Lovely is overflowing with exquisite razor sharp dialogue and phrases - I wanted to frame them up on my wall. Yet there were moments in his dialogue where Marlowe revealed more of himself where he openly expresses out loud or through his train of thought, his vulnerability, his fears and distressed And it felt like the characteristics that we know so well in Marlowe - the sarcasm and hard edge attitude and the excessive drinking problem that was so prominent in this book - was just a way to cover up or to numb those feelings away. Farewell My Lovely is clever plotted crime, not as complex as The Big Sleep, but equally as intriguing and tense, vivid imaginary of seedy LA in the 1940 and superb literature that is a class of its own. Now I’ll leave you with one of my favourite quotes:They had Rembrandt on the calendar that year, a rather smeary self-portrait due to imperfectly registered color plate. It showed him holding a smeared palette with a dirty thumb and wearing a tam-o’-shanter which wasn’t any too clean either. His other hand held a brush poised in the air, as if he might be going to do a little work after a while, if somebody made a down payment. His face was aging, saggy, full of the disgust of life and the thickening effects of liquor.

Amid his interest, Marlowe discovers something much all the more intriguing inside and out. He experiences Moose Molloy, a major bruiser simply out of prison and vigilant for his previous love, Velma. The scene is Florian's, an 'eat and dice emporium', a place where Velma filled in as a vocalist at the season of Moose's conviction nearly eight years back. Before he knows it, Marlowe is ideal smack dab in the middle; Moose, who doesn't appear to know his own particular quality, winds up breaking the block administrator's neck and heads off with a firearm leaving Marlowe to get drawn into the examination.

As do Goodis and Cain, for example, Chandler takes what is often regarded as the formulaic, stereotyped genre of American crime writing and transforms it into literature."Farewell, My Lovely" is Chandler's second novel featuring the private investigator Philip Marlowe, who became the model for many similar characters. The book is told in the first person and is set in Los Angeles and its environs. The plot of the novel is coincidence-ridden and somewhat patched together. It moves from a murder in an African American gambling establishment called Florian's to a jewel heist, a psychic, gambling ships, several more murders, and femme fatales. It takes time to get into the plotting and some of the elements appear not to add up.The plotting is the least important element of this book, but at times it stands in the way. Much of the story gets tied together well at the end and it builds. "Farewell, My Lovely" has many other qualities that make it rewarding. These include Chandler's language, characterizations, sense of place, and view of the human condition, as I describe a little more below.Marlowe speaks in the tough, hard-boiled style of a crime novel, but he has the poet's eye for detail as much as the gimlet eye of the detective. In particular, he shows a gift for the strikingly appropriate and imaginative metaphor or simile that leaps off almost every page.Although a detective easily becomes a stock figure, Chandler's Marlowe is a complex person with vulnerabilities and flaws beneath a hard exterior. He is thoughtful as well as hard-drinking. Similarly, virtually every character in this book is well-defined. Chandler finds both good and bad in unlikely places and is attuned to the difficulties of understanding and categorizing any person.Then, there is the portrayal of Los Angeles. Chandler concentrates of the poor seedy sections but also describes more economically comfortable areas together with suburbs and the water. He offers a sense of place and an eye for detail. He is one of a select group of writers, including Cain, Nathanael West, John Fante, and Charles Bukowski who make Los Angeles come to life.Finally, Chandler offers a view of the human condition that includes each of these three elements and more and that turn "Farewell, My Lovely" into literature. The novel is sad and pessimistic in its view of life but shows as well understanding. "He's a sinner -- but he's human", one of the characters says to Marlowe late in the book in an observation that applies to the entire story. Individuals try to make their ways among corruption, sleaze, frustration, and sadness; but with toughness and a suggestion of the importance of fighting for the good. There are few heroes and few villains.Here is a passage from late in the novel that captures the features I have tried to describe. Marlowe is lying in bed in a cheap waterfront hotel and thinks about some of the events and people that have figured in the story up to that point."It got darker. I thought; and thought in my mind moved with a kind of sluggish stealthiness, as if it was being watched by bitter and sadistic eyes, I thought of dead eyes looking at a moonless sky, with black blood at the corners of the mouths beneath them. I thought of nasty old women beaten to death against the posts of their dirty beds. I thought of a man with bright blond hair who was afraid and didn't quite know what he was afraid of, who was sensitive enough to know that something was wrong and too vain or too dull to guess what it was that was wrong. I thought of beautiful rich women who could be had. I thought of nice slim curious girls who lived alone and could be had too, in a different way. I thought of cops, tough cops that could be greased and yet were not by any means all bad... Fat prosperous cops with Chamber of Commerce voices.... Slim, smart and deadly cops... who for all their smartness and deadliness were not free to do a clean job in a clean way. I thought of sour old goats ... who had given up trying. I thought of Indians and psychotics and dope doctors." [Names of characters have been deleted from the quote.]I was glad to get to know Chandler and Philip Marlowe at last through "Farewell, My Lovely". I also learned a great deal from some of the many thoughtful reader reviews of this book .Robin Friedman

I don't know how long. I had no watch. They don't make that kind of time in watches anyway.”I love several things about Chandler.I love the mood Chandler created with the series - and he did it so well. You are automatically transported to the 30-40s Hollywood movie. It's a black and white movie. And of course Bogart would be our hero. Don't tell me if I am right or wrong. I don't remember if I checked the actors, and it's good that I am with my own imagination with this one.I love Chandler's writing - brutal, straight, and strong. He is a man of few, but powerful words!The story was less attractive than the one in The Big Sleep, and I was less intrigued. Also, I guessed the outcome long before Marlowe started to explain, it was more predictable. And I was a little lost in the plot from the middle of the book. Anyway, Marlowe is becoming my favorite detective. Well, it's Bogart in my mind (again, don't spoil this for me, please) - and nobody is as cool as him as a detective!

Knopf hardcover edition Farewell, My Lovely (1940)[5 rating, especially for the narration performance in the audiobook]"But this Hemingway stuff is what really has me down.""A gag," I said. "An old, old gag.""Who is this Hemingway person at all?""A guy that keeps saying the same thing over and over until you begin to believe it must be good.""That must take a hell of a long time," the big man said. - dialogue excerpt from Chapter 24 of Farewell, My LovelyI've read Raymond Chandler's Farewell, My Lovely several times. The first time was probably as early as 1975, since I still own a copy of the Robert Mitchum movie tie-in edition Farewell, My Lovely. I still find new dialogue and metaphors to enjoy though, such as the above exchange between a heavy-handed cop whom Marlowe keeps calling Hemingway for no apparent reason. Hemingway wasn't offended by the swipe at his early Gertrude Stein influenced repetition style though. He called Chandler the only detective novelist worth reading.Audible recently made this 2021 audiobook edition a $5 Special Offer and I snapped it up immediately as it has the great veteran audiobook narrator Scott Brick as its reader. I then discovered that there is an entire 2021 Raymond Chandler / Philip Marlowe series narrated by Brick, so I'm bound to get a few more of them in the future. They share the cover art with the 1988 Vintage Crime / Black Lizard paperbacks, presumably due to a Random House umbrella tie-in.Farewell, My Lovely was formed by Chandler recycling 3 of his earlier short stories. These come together very well unlike some later Chandler books where plot points sometimes remained unresolved. It is the atmosphere and characterization that is the key draw and the actual solving of the crimes is almost secondary.As expected, the narration by Scott Brick was excellent. Chapter intermissions were highlighted by the use of film noir-like music to heighten the atmosphere. Other ReviewsThe DetNovel.com summary via Web.Archive details the plot (Spoilers Obviously) but is excellent for explaining several literary allusions in Chandler's metaphors.Trivia and LinksFarewell, My Lovely has been adapted three times for film, although the early versions did not use the book's title. The 1975 version directed by Dick Richards had Robert Mitchum in the Philip Marlowe role and a trailer can be seen here and the entire film here. This version, although reasonably faithful overall, has an increased level of gunfights, making it seem like more of a mob movie.The 1944 version was released under the title Murder My Sweet dir. Edward Emytryk with Dick Powell in the Philip Marlowe role. A trailer can be seen here.The 1942 version used the Raymond Chandler plot and adapted it as the 3rd outing for actor George Sanders' series character The Falcon in The Falcon Take Over dir. Irving Reis. I did not find a trailer for it.
